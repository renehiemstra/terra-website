Compared to C++, Terra forgoes certain flexibilities, such as constructors, in favor of a concise Rule of Three (dtor, copy, move) characterized by simple and safe rules. It enhances performance over C++ for R-values by consistently employing a bitwise copy (memcpy), avoiding C++\u2019s potential for implicit copying or dependence on optimizations. For L-values, Terra invokes a move method to ensure explicit resource transfer, with efficient defaults delivering predictable performance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"resource-management/core-concepts":{"id":"resource-management/core-concepts","title":"Core concepts","description":"Below we summarize the core concepts and rules relevant to resource management in Terra.

For instance, short-lived temporary objects can leverage fast, fixed-size stack allocations, while long-running processes can benefit from strategies that minimize fragmentation.
