Welcome to the new website. Terra has significantly evolved over the last year and is now even more poweful.

* Terra now comes with a powerful deterministic resource management system similar to Rust or C++.
* A standard library with powerful feature including allocators, concept-based multiple dispatch, ranges, linear algebra, unit-testing, threads and more.
* A new package manager and registry called Cosm that always yields consistent builds.

Happy metaprogramming!
