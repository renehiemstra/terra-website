# Multistage programming in Terra
Multistage programming is a cornerstone of Terra's design, enabling developers to write code that generates and specializes other code at compile-time. By treating Terra's functions, types, variables, and expressions as first-class values in Lua, multistage programming allows for dynamic code construction, optimization, and specialization. This paradigm, rooted in the interplay between Lua's flexibility and Terra's high-performance compilation, empowers developers to create efficient, adaptive programs with minimal boilerplate.

## Dynamic Code Generation
The design of Terra stems from the insight that C/C++ effectively comprises multiple "languages": a core language of operators, control flow, and function calls, surrounded by a fragmented meta-language including the preprocessor, templating system, and struct definitions. While C++ templates are Turing-complete and have enabled optimized libraries like Eigen, they are notoriously cumbersome in practice.

Terra embraces and extends this trend by replacing C/C++'s ad-hoc meta-language with a full-fledged programming language: Lua. This pairing of a low-level systems language with a high-level scripting language unlocks capabilities beyond traditional systems. Unlike C/C++, Terra code can be JIT-compiled and executed interleaved with Lua, simplifying the creation of libraries that rely on runtime code generation.

As a result, features from other languages—such as conditional compilation and templating—emerge organically from Lua's metaprogramming of Terra. For example, templated types, akin to C++ templates but far more flexible, arise through Lua's dynamic code generation, supporting parameterized structs and functions without rigid syntax. Arbitrary compile-time computations, like producing optimized kernels based on runtime parameters or domain-specific abstractions, become simple Lua scripts that seamlessly integrate high-performance Terra code with expressive metaprogramming.

Multistage programming further empowers Terra to dynamically generate code tailored to specific scenarios, such as functions optimized for input sizes, hardware targets, or constraints. This is invaluable for tasks like loop unrolling, constant folding, or SIMD vectorization, all orchestrated via Lua for efficient, adaptive execution.

Conditional compilation is done with control-flow that determines what code is defined.

  <summary>Example: loop unrolling in polynomial evaluation</summary>

We explore loop unrolling in Terra for evaluating a cubic polynomial $ p(x) = a + b \cdot x + c \cdot x^2 + d \cdot x^3 $, where coefficients are stored in a struct array (`coeffs[0] = a`, `coeffs[1] = b`,  `coeffs[2] = c`,  `coeffs[3] = d`.). Horner's method rewrites the polynomial as $ a + x \cdot (b + x \cdot (c + x \cdot d)) $ to minimize multiplications and additions, improving numerical stability and performance.

Terra's metaprogramming capabilities allow us to unroll loops at compile time, generating explicit, optimized code without runtime overhead. The following code defines a generic, templated Polynomial evaluator supporting float or double types. It uses loop unrolling in the eval method to produce efficient, branch-free code.

```terra file=./tutorials/tutorial-resource-management/tutorial-poly-standard.t start=poly_start end=poly_end
```
To create a cubic polynomial type with float coefficients:
```terra 
local poly = Polynomial(float, 4) -- Generates and caches the type
```
Inspect the unrolled eval method using `:printpretty()` to see the expanded Terra code:
```
tutorial-poly.t:31:     terra poly.eval(self : &poly,x : float) : float
tutorial-poly.t:32:         var y : float = [&float]((@self).coeffs)[3] -- c
tutorial-poly.t:36:         y = x * y + [&float]((@self).coeffs)[2]     -- x*d + c
tutorial-poly.t:36:         y = x * y + [&float]((@self).coeffs)[1]     -- x*(x*d + c) + b
tutorial-poly.t:36:         y = x * y + [&float]((@self).coeffs)[0]     -- x*(x*(x*d + c) + b) + a
tutorial-poly.t:40:         return y
tutorial-poly.t:31:     end
```
This shows the loop fully unrolled into sequential multiply-adds, ready for further optimization by the compiler.

View the generated assembly with `:disas()` (with -O3 on an AMD CPU):
```
assembly for function at address 0x722b5a3bb000
0x722b5a3bb000(+0):             vmulsd  xmm1, xmm0, qword ptr [rdi + 24]
0x722b5a3bb005(+5):             vaddsd  xmm1, xmm1, qword ptr [rdi + 16]
0x722b5a3bb00a(+10):            vmulsd  xmm1, xmm1, xmm0
0x722b5a3bb00e(+14):            vaddsd  xmm1, xmm1, qword ptr [rdi + 8]
0x722b5a3bb013(+19):            vmulsd  xmm0, xmm1, xmm0
0x722b5a3bb017(+23):            vaddsd  xmm0, xmm0, qword ptr [rdi]
0x722b5a3bb01b(+27):            ret
```
This code is already quite efficient with 7 instructions (3 multiplies, 3 adds, 1 return) and 3 registers (an input/output register `xmm0`, a register `xmm1` to hold a temporary, and a general purpose register `rdi` to point to the coefficient array).

  <summary>Example: Optimizing with LLVM Intrinsics for fused-multiply-addition (FMA) </summary>

We can further optimize the code of the previous example by fusing the addition and multiplication into one operation. The intrinsic (llvm.fma.f64 or llvm.fma.f32) ensures the compiler emits hardware FMA instructions (e.g., vfmadd213sd), reducing instruction count, latency, and rounding errors.

Here's the optimized code integrated into the Polynomial factory (replace the original eval method and add the intrinsic definition):
```terra file=./tutorials/tutorial-resource-management/tutorial-poly-optimized.t start=polyeval_start end=polyeval_end
```

The Terra intrinsic declaration maps directly to LLVM's FMA operation, selecting `llvm.fma.f32` for floats or `llvm.fma.f64` for doubles based on type `T`. It takes three `T` arguments (x, y, z) and returns `T`, computing $ x \cdot y + z $—perfect for Horner's nesting. This results in the following assembly with 5 instructions and 3 fused-multiply-adds.
```
assembly for function at address 0x736c9cc8a000
0x736c9cc8a000(+0):             vmovsd  xmm1, qword ptr [rdi + 24]
0x736c9cc8a005(+5):             vfmadd213sd     xmm1, xmm0, qword ptr [rdi + 16]
0x736c9cc8a00b(+11):            vfmadd213sd     xmm1, xmm0, qword ptr [rdi + 8]
0x736c9cc8a011(+17):            vfmadd213sd     xmm0, xmm1, qword ptr [rdi]
0x736c9cc8a016(+22):            ret
```

## Implementing Compiler Features as Libraries
Multistage programming empowers users to implement language extensions—typically reserved for compiler developers—as simple Lua libraries. This capability stems from Terra's design: Lua serves as a staging language to generate and specialize Terra code dynamically at compile time. Features like lambdas, generics, or custom optimizations can be built modularly without altering the core compiler, enabling rapid prototyping, better portability, and user-defined DSLs. This library-based approach democratizes language design, shifting complexity from monolithic compilers to reusable modules, and reduces overhead by generating efficient, specialized code on-the-fly.

  <summary>Example: Implementing Lambdas as a Library in Terra </summary>

In traditional languages, lambdas (anonymous functions with captures) require compiler support for closure creation, variable capturing, and invocation. In Terra, multistage programming allows this to be implemented concisely as a Lua library using macros and structs. The following code creates function objects that wrap a Terra function, capture variables in a struct, and overload the apply metamethod for invocation. It's only a few lines, demonstrating the power of multistage programming to implement compiler features.

```terra file=./tutorials/tutorial-resource-management/liblambda.t start=lambda_new_start end=lambda_new_end
```
By loading this small library you can define and use lambda's as follows:
```terra file=./tutorials/tutorial-resource-management/tutorial-lambda.t start=tutorial_lambda_start end=tutorial_lambda_end
```
