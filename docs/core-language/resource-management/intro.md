# Resource management in Terra
Resource management is a critical aspect of programming languages, and Terra’s new system blends C++’s flexibility with Rust’s ownership principles to deliver safe, efficient defaults while unlocking its metaprogramming potential. In the sections that follow, we’ll explore the core concepts, ownership model, key methods, and practical tutorials—from basic data structures to advanced integrations—showcasing how Terra balances performance, safety, and adaptability.

## Approaches to resource management
Resource management in programming languages typically falls into one of three categories:

1. **Manual Allocation and Deallocation**: Developers explicitly allocate and free resources, like in C.
    - Advantages: Offers precise control over resource use and timing, maximizing performance in low-level systems.
    - Disadvantages: Prone to human error (e.g., leaks, double frees), requiring meticulous management.
2. **Automatic Garbage Collection**: A runtime system handles resource cleanup, common in languages like Java or Python.
    - Advantages: Simplifies coding by automating cleanup, reducing memory-related bugs.
    - Disadvantages: Introduces runtime overhead and unpredictable pauses, less suited for high performance applications.
3. **Scope-Bound Resource Management**: Resources are tied to object lifetimes and automatically released when objects go out of scope, a hallmark of languages like C++ and Rust (see [RAII on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization)).
    - Advantages: Abstracts resource handling beyond memory (e.g., files, mutexes), ensuring deterministic cleanup with minimal overhead while enhancing safety and predictability.
    - Disadvantages: Poses a challenging engineering problem to achieve a fully safe system, where languages like Rust have set the standard.

Historically, Terra relied solely on manual, C-style resource management. Though effective, this method restricted the full potential of Terra’s powerful metaprogramming capabilities. To overcome this constraint, the current implementation introduces scope-bound resource management, bringing Terra closer to modern programming standards while maintaining its performance and metaprogramming edge.

## Scope-Bound Resource Management (RAII)
In scope-bound resource management or RAII, a resource’s lifecycle is bound to a stack-allocated object that manages it. When the object exits its scope — unless explicitly returned — the associated resource is automatically released. 

Examples of resources that can be managed this way are:
- Heap-allocated memory
- Threads of execution
- Open network sockets
- Open files
- Locked mutexes
- Disk space allocations
- Database connections

In Terra's standard library, we currently use scope-bound resource management to manage [memory allocation](./../../standard-library/allocators/intro.md) and shared memory [threads of execution](./../../standard-library/threads/intro.md).

## Exploring Terra’s Resource System
In the sections that follow, we explore the specifics of Terra’s resource management system. We begin with the core concepts that define this approach, followed by an in-depth look at the ownership model driving it. Next, we examine the methods governing destruction, move, and copy assignment, including advanced techniques for fine-tuning move and copy semantics. The section concludes with hands-on tutorials showcasing practical applications, from basic data structures to advanced integrations.
